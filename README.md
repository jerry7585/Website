# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project serves as a showcase of my skills, experiences, and passion for continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of technology. I built this website as a way to present myself and learn a new field in Software Engineering, the front-end side.

## Overview

This portfolio website is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a focus on clean, responsive design and user experience. I deployed the website using **Firebase Hosting**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the website. Focus on responsive design principles for optimal viewing across all devices.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity and functionality to the site, such as form validation and dynamic content updates.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Deployed the website using Firebase, taking advantage of its speed, scalability, and ease of use.
- **Git/GitHub**: Used version control to track changes, collaborate on features, and host the project repository.

## Skills and Learnings

Throughout the development of this portfolio website, I enhanced several key skills that are vital for my growth as a software engineer:

1. **Frontend Development**: I honed my ability to build clean, functional websites that provide a seamless user experience. I focused on designing a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and ensures accessibility.
2. **Problem-Solving**: While developing this portfolio, I faced numerous challenges since I have no prior experience in front-end engineering. From ensuring cross-browser compatibility to improving the performance of certain interactive elements. These experiences helped me strengthen my problem-solving and debugging abilities.
